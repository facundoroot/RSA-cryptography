# RSA cryptography

the RSA cryptography is used by an emisor and receptor as a way to communicate encrypting the messages so no-one except both of them can decipher them.
this system asgins the letters numbers between 0 and 127 and creates a public and private key, using properties of prime numbers so only people with the public key can undesrtand the message.
The RSA system works even today because there are not known algorithms that can efficiently factorize big numbers
To understand the projocet it is required to have notions of general algebra, algebra of natural and prime numbers, basic analitic math.
